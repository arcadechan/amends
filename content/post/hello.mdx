Welcome to Amends! The name's Arcade, and I'm a web developer! This site was built with [Next JS 13 (App Router beta)](https://nextjs.org/), [Tina CMS](https://tina.io), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and many other tools. You should check them out! You can also check out this project on Github: [https://github.com/arcadechan/amends](https://github.com/arcadechan/amends)

I've used Next JS a lot in the past, but the release of the App Router beta really motivated me to get my blog project started. It's been a long time coming, and it's finally here!

As for the blog itself the contents won't just be web development. My other interests include music, art, film, and writing. I also love building keyboards and just got a new one which I plan on documenting the build process here.

But, being a web developer, all things return to development, surely. So stay on the lookout for any cool one-off pages or projects on the site, like this audio player I built to talk about music!
